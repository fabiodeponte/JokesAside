Old sailors never die , they just get a little dinghy .
      -  The joke is a pun.  A dinghy is a small boat usually used for getting to and from a main boat.  The word 'dinghy' sounds like 'ding' which could be taken as a 'dent' or meaning 'slightly damaged'.

      -  
      -  These old professions jokes rarely work because the puns are not metaphors for dying.

Glue inventors have to stick to it .
      -  The joke is a pun I think? Glue is used to stick objects together.  The phrase 'stick to it' typically means to keep trying at something to get the job done successfully.
      -  
      -  stick to it can mean keep at it or it can mean something literally sticking to something
      -  This is a cheap pun. 'stick to it' means not giving up, and also refers to the job of glue.

Communism is a complicated thing . You must think about from all sorts of Engels .
      -  
      -  This is a pun on the phrase 'think about it from all sorts of angles' which means to try look at something from different perspectives, but 'Engel' is used instead of 'angle' because it sounds similar and because Friedrich Engels was a philospher who co-authored The Communist Manifesto 
      -  Engles sounds like angles 
      -  This joke needs to be better written. It's a pun on 'angles', or perspectives, and 'Engels' - a famous communist.
      -  This is a pun on the word Engels. Friendrich Engels was a famous communist. Engels sounds like angles.

OLD WEATHERMEN never die , they reign forever .
      -  This is a pun. 'Rain' sounds like 'reign'.  Rain is precipitation from the clouds in the atmosphere, while 'reign' is a word that refers to a ruler's period of control over a land.  Instead of dying, old weathermen reign forever.
      -  
      -  
      -  This is the uncommon 'OLD PROFESSIONS' joke that works because it's not trying to be a pun on death. Rather, 'reign forever' implies professional immortality as well as being a pun on 'rain', a type of precipitation that weathermen predict.
      -  This is a pun on the word "reign". Weathermen predict when it is going to rain, and rain sounds like reign.

OLD NITPICKERS never die , they just feel lousy .

      -  
      -  These OLD PROFESSIONS jokes rarely work because the puns are not metaphors for dying.
      -  This is a pun on the word lousy and nitpicker. The word nitpicker sounds like someone who picks nits, the eggs of lice, out of their hair. Lousy sounds like the word louse.

A lot of trees were dying , but they needed to figure out the root of the problem .
      -  This is a pun.  'Root' can mean two things.  Plants have roots in the ground to absorb water and nutrients.  'The root of the problem' is a phrase that means 'the underlying cause' of some problem.
      -  This is a pun on 'root of the problem', which means the source of a problem but it's aldo being used because trees have roots
      -  root can mean a tree root or it can mean the sorce of a problem 
      -  This would work better if it were better written. The 'root' of the problem refers to the source of the mass tree deaths, as well as being a pun on the roots of the trees themselves. Perhaps the problem lay at their literal roots!
      -  This is a pun on the word root and how trees have roots.

OLD STOREKEEPERS never die , they just sale away .

      -  This is a pun on 'sail away' which means to sail off on a boat, but 'sale' is used instead because it sounds similar and store keepers usually have items for sale
      -  sale sounds like sail

It ' s amazing what two or more sinners can achieve together with synergy .
      -  I think the joke is just word play? 'Synergy' sounds like it has the word 'sinner' in it. 'Synergy' means working together or cooperating.
      -  This is a pun on 'synergy' which is defined as the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects. In this case, the two sinners are the agents, and 'synergy' sounds slightly similar to 'sinners'
      -  synergy sounds like sin 
      -  The joke would be funnier if anyone outside of religious circles used the word 'sinners' in common parlance anymore. Synergy is the union of two forces and is also a pun on the collaboration of sinners.
      -  This is a pun on the word synergy. Synergy has the sound of the word "sin" in it.

A city worker who campaigned for new sewer pipes finally had to go underground .
      -  I think the joke is a pun. 'Going underground' can mean to hide from the public.  It can also mean physically going under the ground through digging, for example. Since they are talking about setting up sewer pipelines, it would involve physically going underground to build.
      -  
      -  go underground can mean go through illicit channels or it can mean literally putting pipes underground 
      -  The joke is funny because it's realistic. The city worker had to campaign 'underground', or under the radar due to pushback, and they literally had to go underground because that's where sewer pipes get installed.
      -  This is a pun about how sewer pipes are underground.

The runaway beer truck barrelled down the freeway after its driver was mugged .
      -  I think the joke is a pun.  One could drink beer from a mug. The word 'mugged' means being robbed in person by someone.
      -  This is a pun on 'mugged' which means to get robbed, but it's also being used here since beer is associated with mugs 
      -  
      -  Poor driver. The driver got 'mugged', or stolen from, and 'mugged' is a pun on the kind of cup beers are traditionally drunk from. Also, 'barrelled' could refer to the speed of the truck, and also a pun on beer barrels

As to how to play snooker , some people don ' t have a cue .
      -  The joke is a play on words. Snooker is a game like billiards that is played by using a pool cue.  'Cue' sounds similar to 'clue' so in the phrase 'some people don't have a clue', the word used instead was 'cue'.
      -  This is a pun on 'don't have a clue' which means having no idea how to do something, but 'cue' is used in it's place because it sounds like 'clue' and a cue is also what you play snooker with 
      -  cue sounds like clue

The satellite went into orbit on January 1st causing a new year ' s revolution .
      -  The joke is a play on words. A sattelite will revolve the Earth when in orbit.  This happened on new year's eve, and at that time people make 'new year's resolutions' of things they'll do differently that year.  The words 'revolution' and 'resolution' are similar, so the line was changed to 'new year's revolution'.
      -  This is a pun on 'New Year's resolution' which is when a person resolves to continue good practices, change an undesired trait or behavior, accomplish a personal goal, or otherwise improve their behaviour. 'Revolution' is used in it's place because it sounds similar and because when a satellite orbits the planet it's known as a resolution 
      -  
      -  The satellite began its revolution around the astronomical body on 1/1, causing someone to make a pun about 'New Year's Resolutions/Revolutions'.
      -  This is a pun on how "revolution" sounds like the "resolution" in "New Year's resolution". A revolution is when you circle around something, as the satellite's orbit does.

The forecaster was away because he was under the weather .
      -  The joke is a pun.  Forecasters predict the weather. Being 'under the weather' means feeling sick or unwell.
      -  This is a pun on 'under the weather' which means to be sick, but it's also being used since forecasters deal with weather
      -  under the weather can mean sick or it can literally refer to the weather 
      -  He was 'under the weather', meaning sick, or possibly, he was literally underneath the weather he was reporting.
      -  This is a pun on the phrase "under the weather" and how forecasters forecast the weather.

For a chronically absent employee : It seemed her career was just taking off .
      -  The joke is a pun.  'Taking off' is a phrase that can mean 'growing successfully' as it relates one's career to a rocket launch.  To be 'taking off' a day from work would mean to call out.  The chronically absent employee's career was just 'taking off' time from work.
      -  
      -  
      -  This joke fails because it implies opposite things in an attempt to pun. If someone's chronically absent, their career would not be flourishing.
      -  This is a pun on the phrase "taking off" and how an employee who is often absent would be taking off frequently.

' ' Nobody has scored yet in the tennis game , ' ' said Tom lovingly .

      -  
      -  
      -  It's weirdly written; that's why this joke isn't funny. 'lovingly' is supposed to be a pun on 'love', or a 0 score in tennis, but it makes no sense in context.
      -  This is a pun on the word "lovingly". It has the word love in it and love is a term in tennis that means a score of 0.

Shotgun wedding : A case of wife or death .
      -  The joke is a pun.  A 'shotgun wedding' is a very quick wedding ceromony.  The speaker calls it 'wife or death' as a parody of the phrase 'life or death', as if there was a real shotgun fire arm involved in the wedding.
      -  This is a pun on 'life or death', which is defined as deciding whether someone lives or dies; vitally important. In this case 'wife' is used in it's place because it sounds similar and due to the marriage connotation 
      -  wife sounds like life 
      -  In a dark way, this joke sort of works. While the phrase 'shotgun wedding' does indeed imply 'wife or death' as the joke puts it, it usually means something very different: a wedding that happens between two people already expecting a baby.

      -  
      -  ante sounds like aunty

I used to be addicted to soap , but I ' m clean now .
      -  The joke is a pun.  To say someone is 'clean' after rehabilitating themselves for an addiction, it means they are no longer taking the substance they were addicted to.  Soap is used for cleaning things.
      -  This is a pun on 'clean' which in this context is being used to mean the speaker is no longer addicted to soap, but it's also being used because soap is used to clean things 
      -  clean can mean addiction free or it can mean the oposite of dirty 
      -  This is a funnier joke that works because it implies the speaker is lying. To be 'clean' of an addiction is to not be using that substance, but since it's used here as a play on what soap does, the speaker is probably still addicted and telling people in a tongue-n-cheek kind of way.
      -  This is a pun on the word "clean". Soap is used to clean things and going clean is a slang term for giving up an addiction.

The IRS left a message on my cell phone that I owed them more money . It was a taxed message .
      -  The joke is a pun.  The IRS handles taxation.  The words 'tax' and 'text' are similar, so the speaker calls it a 'taxed message' instead of a 'text message' that was sent to their phone.
      -  This is a pun on 'taxed message', which in this case means to make heavy demands on someones reasources. It's also being used because the IRS deals with taxes
      -  taxed sounds like text 
      -  Gotta hate those messages. The message might've literally cost money to the receiver, or been taxed. Here though 'taxed message' is a pun on 'text message'.
      -  This is a pun on the word "taxed". The IRS collects taxes and "taxed" sounds like "text".

      -  This is a pun on 'leafing' which is used because it sounds like 'leaving' and because trees have leaves
      -  leafing sounds like leaving 
      -  This pun is a little too on the nose. Trees leaf in spring, and 'leafing' is a pun on 'leaving'.

I used to be afraid of purchasing residential property for the purpose of renting , but now I have an apartment complex .
      -  The joke is a pun.  The word 'complex' can mean to have a psychological tick or behaviour surrounding a topic.  An 'apartment complex' is a building that has separate apartments in it for renting.
      -  This is a pun on 'complex' which is this context is meaning a related group of emotionally significant ideas that are completely or partly repressed and that cause psychic conflict leading to abnormal mental states or behavior, but it's also being used because an alternative meaning of 'complex' is a group of similar buildings or facilities on the same site, like that of an apartment complex
      -  
      -  A 'complex' usually refers to something psychological, but here it's also used in the sense of owned property, making this a double-meaning joke.
      -  This is a pun on the word "complex". A complex is an idea that unconsciously affects the way you act, think, and feel. In this case, it is the fear of buying properties to rent, such as apartment complexes, that creates a complex for the person in the joke.

The shoemaker did not deny his apprentice anything he needed . He gave his awl .
      -  The joke is a pun. 'Gave his awl' is a parody of the phrase 'gave his all' which means to put in maximum effort into a task.  An awl is a small pointed tool used for piercing holes, especially in leather, which would be used by a leather shoe maker.
      -  
      -  awl sounds like all

      -  This is a pun on 'Maine' which is a state, known as vactionland, but it also sounds exactly similar to 'main' which means chief in size or importance which is what the intent of this meant 
      -  maine sounds like main 
      -  This is accurate but not all that funny. It was Bush's primary vacation spot in the state of Maine (another pun)

      -

Greys Anatomy has many humerus remarks .
      -  The joke is a pun.  'Humerus' is the name of a bone in the body, and sounds like the word 'humorous' which means jokingly, funny, or comical.  Grey's Anatomy is a show about doctors and nurses in a hospital, so the word 'humorous' was replaced with 'humerus' the bone.
      -  
      -  humerus sounds like humorous 
      -  Greys Anatomy is a TV show named after the original famous anatomical diagram, and also, 'humerus' here serves as both a play on 'humorous' and a reference to a type of bone in the human body.
      -  This is a pun on the word "humerus", which sounds like "humorous" and refers to a kind of bone. Bones are related to the tv show Grey's Anatomy because it takes place in a hospital, a medical setting, and its title was inspired by Gray's Anatomy, a book on anatomy.

      -  This is a pun on 'beef' which in this context means a fued, like being mad at gravy if it's lumpy,  but it's also being used since beef is a food that can be served with gravy 
      -  beef can mean literal meat or it can mean a fight 
      -  He could've had an issue, or 'beef' with his gravy because it was too lumpy, or he could've chosen a lumpy beef to eat with his gravy.
      -  This is a pun on the word "beef". "Beef" is meat from cows that can be made into gravy or eaten with gravy poured on top. The phrase "have beef" is an idiom that means to be angry or annoyed at someone or something. The gravy still had lumps of beef in it. The person was bothered by the gravy's lumpiness so he "had beef" with it.

I couldn ' t quite remember how to throw a boomerang , but eventually it came back to me .
      -  The joke is a play on words.  Boomerangs are designed to return to the point they were thrown from when flung through the air.  The phrase 'it came back to me' can usually mean 'I remembered it', but in this case the boomerang might have literally come back.
      -  This is a pun on 'eventually it came back to me' which means that eventually the speaker figured out how to use a boomerang. It also works because boomerangs literally come back to you after you throw them 
      -  came back to me can refer to how a boomerang circles back or it can mean remembering something 
      -  The person eventually remembered how to throw a boomerang, and the object literally returned to their hand when they did.
